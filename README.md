Jbovlasisku : A Lojban quick dictionary

Usage:
Start the program with no arguments to open an interactive session, or provide arguments
to do an immediate single search.

To find English gloss words, gismu, cmavo, and rafsi, and to decompose lujvo, just type
in the word and hit enter. A word starting with a capital letter will cause a search for
a selma`o. A search starting and ending with a forward slash will be a regex search over definitions.

Note that this program is not a validator; it may return output even for badly formed lujvo.
